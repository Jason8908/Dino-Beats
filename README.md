# Dino Beats
A discord music bot. Made by the same person who co-created Zombie Dino. This project is in early development, and as a result, there are many bugs and unfinished features to be added later on. 

## Current Features
*A help menu that will assist the user by telling them the syntax of the commands featured with the bot.*
